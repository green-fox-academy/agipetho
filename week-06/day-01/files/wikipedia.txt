Music video
The official music video was directed by Phil Andelman and released on 26 March 2018.[2]

The clip opens with Bay wearing a sparkling crew neck sweater while he and his band play on an Ed Sullivan Show type of broadcast playing into the living rooms of quiet suburban homes. Bay, who takes on the role as an astronaut trapped on Earth, is seen sneaking into a house's garage late at night to build a rocket ship. The highly anticipated blast off at the end of the video reveals the truth — a young Bay sitting in a “rocket” made out of a silver cardboard box, and the fantasy of escaping our planet vanishes."[3]

Bay said “The inspiration behind the video comes from the theme of escape that runs through the song. I was reminded of a time when I was about 4 years old and I told my parents I'd had enough of living with them and would be leaving home.”[4]

Reception
Rania Aniftos from Rolling Stone called the single “catchy” and a “delicious new rock song”.[5]

Jon Blisten, also from Rolling Stone, said ""Pink Lemonade" marks a notable departure from both the stripped-down folk of Bay's debut album, but also the textured electronic sound of Electric Light's lead single, "Wild Love". Instead, the tune embraces a dance-rock sound reminiscent of The Strokes or Hot Hot Heat."[1]
